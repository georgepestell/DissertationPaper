The work done for this project is fundamentally exploratorary, and so there are many areas in which improvements could be made.

One of the tertiary aims of this project that was not met was in creating an interactive frontend pre-set creator. The core design of the cost function's features could allow nodes to represent the Features, with input and output nodes allowing output's to be connected to the inputs of other nodes.

This would be perfectly suited to a compositor-like frontend, and further research could explore creating a pre-set editor.
